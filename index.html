Teams of agents often have to coordinate their decisions in a distributed manner to achieve both individual and shared goals. Examples include service-oriented computing, sensor network problems, and smart devices coordination homes problems. The resulting Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) is NP-hard to solve, and the multi-agent coordination process non-trivial. Examples include service-oriented computing, sensor network problems, smart devices coordination homes problems or collective of autonomous robots. The resulting Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) is NP-hard to solve, and the multi-agent coordination process non-trivial.

The Tutorial on Multi-Agent Distributed Constrained Optimization is composed of two parts and will provide an overview of DCOPs, focusing on its algorithms and some of its applications. In the first theoretical part, we will present an accessible and structured overview of the core concepts and models. We will also expound the available optimal and suboptimal approaches to solve DCOPs. We will discuss recent extensions to the DCOP framework to capture agents acting in a dynamic environment and/or using asymmetric costs/rewards.
In the second practical part, we will invite the attendance to model some sample problems coming from real applications, and discuss the relevant solutions methods. Some code and executable examples, developed using the python library pyDCOP, will be provided and analyzed. The tutorial will conclude with the most recurrent challenges and open questions.</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Outline">
<p>
The Tutorial on Multi-Agent Distributed Constrained Optimization is expected to be a half-day tutorial alternates both theoretical and practical concepts on DCOP models, algorithms and applications to the Internet-of-Things field. Some time is devoted to apply these concepts on Raspberry Pis.
</p>

<p>
The overall programme is as follows:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>DCOP Framework [30min]: theoretical presentation of the DCOP model and some issues raised when applying them to the specific case of IoT.</li>
<li>Hands on PyDCOP I [20min]: practical illustration of the definition of DCOPs using the pyDCOP programmig environment.</li>
<li>Focus on Some Solution Methods [30min]: presentation of some DCOP solution methods which have good properties to be deployed on IoT environments (DPOP, Max-Sum, DSA, MGM).</li>
<li>Hands on PyDCOP II [20min]: practical illustration of running the reviewed algorithms on some toy problems.</li>
<li>Focus on Smart Environment Configuration Problems Distributing Computations [30min]: ex- ploration of a smart environment problem that illustrates the potential of using DCOPs in IoT envi- ronments. We also raise and solve the problem of distributing computations on the different objects in the environment.</li>
<li>Hands on PyDCOP III [20min]: pratical application of the distribution notions.</li>
<li>Dynamic DCOPs [30min]: discusses how to repair a DCOP deloyment as to ensure the resilience of the embedded systems, using the pyDCOP repair utilities.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The practical session relies on an Open Source library that is available at <a href="https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/">https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/</a>
pyDCOP. A virtual machine containing all the required libraries and software is provided for download.

<h2 id="audience"><a id="org4b4186a"></a><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Audience</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-audience">
<p>
We expect an heterogeneous audience interested in applying artificial agent and multiagent techniques to the Internet-of-Things, with a focus on distributed optimization.
</p>

<p>
The first part can be attended by anyone familiar with constraint-based reasoning and multi-agent systems. Programming (e.g. Python) and problem modeling (constraint based modeling, linear programming, optimization) skills are basic requirements to follow the practical second part.
</p>

<p>
For many year DCOP topic has been part of summer school and tutorial session of main AI and multi-agent systems conferences (IJCAI, ECAI, AAMAS). Beside, the OPTMAS-DCR workshop series also attract AAMAS attendants since 2010. We add here a more « practical » dimension to the topics by applying such techniques to the Internet-of-Things, which could generate up to $11.1 trillion a year in economic value by 2025, and which is thus an attractive application field for AI and Multi-Agent researchers.
We are thus confident about the attractiveness of our tutorial for the AAMAS audience.
